Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

1. The Birth of Software Engineering (1968)
The term software engineering was introduced at the NATO Software Engineering Conference to address the "software crisis" caused by increasing complexity and inefficiencies in software development.
This milestone emphasized structured programming, better development methodologies, and systematic testing to improve software reliability.
The Rise of Object-Oriented Programming (1980s)

2. Object-oriented programming (OOP) introduced concepts like classes, objects, and inheritance, making code more reusable, modular, and easier to maintain.
Languages like C++, Java, and later Python adopted OOP principles, significantly improving software development efficiency.

3. The Agile Revolution (2001)
The Agile Manifesto was introduced to promote flexible, iterative development over rigid, documentation-heavy processes.
Agile methodologies like Scrum and Kanban improved collaboration, adaptability, and faster software delivery, shaping modern software engineering practices.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

1. Planning – Defines project goals, scope, resources, and feasibility to ensure a clear development roadmap.
2. Requirements Analysis – Gathers and documents user needs to determine software functionality and constraints.
3. Design – Creates system architecture, user interfaces, and database structures to outline how the software will work.
4. Implementation (Coding) – Developers write and compile code based on the design specifications.
5. Testing – Identifies and fixes errors through unit testing, integration testing, and system testing to ensure software quality.
6. Deployment – Releases the software for user access, either as a full launch or in phases.
7.Maintenance – Provides updates, bug fixes, and improvements to keep the software functional and secure

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

1.Waterfall vs. Agile Methodologies
Waterfall follows a sequential approach where each phase—planning, design, development, testing, and deployment—must be completed before moving to the next. Changes are difficult to implement once development starts, making it best suited for projects with well-defined requirements. It relies heavily on documentation and has minimal client involvement after the initial planning phase. Testing occurs only after the development phase is complete, leading to longer development cycles.
Agile, on the other hand, is an iterative and flexible approach where development happens in small cycles called sprints. Changes can be made at any stage based on feedback, allowing for continuous improvement. Agile minimizes documentation and focuses on working software, with regular collaboration between developers and clients. Testing is ongoing throughout the process, enabling faster issue resolution and quicker releases.

2. When to Use Each Methodology

Waterfall is ideal for projects with fixed requirements, such as developing a banking system, where security and regulatory compliance are strict, and changes are minimal. Since the project is structured, planning everything in advance reduces risks.
Agile is better for dynamic projects like a mobile app startup, where user feedback and market trends frequently change. Agile allows for continuous updates and quick adaptations, ensuring that the final product aligns with user needs.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

SOFTWARE DEVELOPER

1. Writes, tests, and maintains code based on project requirements.
2. Translates system design into functional software applications.
3. Debugs and troubleshoots issues to ensure software runs smoothly.
4. Collaborates with designers, testers, and other developers to integrate components.
5. Keeps up with new technologies to improve software efficiency and security.
   
Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer

1. Designs and executes test plans to identify software defects.
2. Ensures the software meets quality standards, functionality, and security requirements.
3. Automates testing processes to improve efficiency and accuracy.
4. Works with developers to fix bugs and optimize performance.
5. Documents test results and suggests improvements to enhance user experience.

Project Manager

1. Oversees the software development process, ensuring deadlines and budgets are met.
2. Defines project scope, sets goals, and allocates resources.
3. Communicates with stakeholders to ensure project alignment with business objectives.
4. Manages risks and resolves conflicts within the team.
5. Tracks progress, facilitates meetings, and ensures smooth collaboration among team members

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.  
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) 
IDEs provide a centralized platform for coding, debugging, and testing, improving developer efficiency. They include features like syntax highlighting, code completion, debugging tools, and built-in terminal support. IDEs help reduce errors and speed up development by integrating various tools into one interface.  

Examples of IDEs: 
- Visual Studio Code (VS Code) – A lightweight, extensible IDE with rich plugin support.  
- IntelliJ IDEA– Popular for Java development, with smart code assistance.  
- Eclipse – Widely used for Java, Python, and C++ development.  

Version Control Systems (VCS) 
VCS helps track changes to code, allowing multiple developers to collaborate effectively. It maintains a history of modifications, enabling developers to revert to previous versions if issues arise. VCS also facilitates branching, merging, and managing different project versions.  

Examples of VCS:
- Git – The most widely used VCS, allowing distributed version control and collaboration.  
- Subversion (SVN) – A centralized VCS used in enterprise environments.  
- Mercurial – A distributed VCS similar to Git, known for its simplicity and performance.  


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

1. Unit Testing
-Focuses on testing individual components or functions of a program.
-Ensures each unit works as expected before integrating it with other parts.
-Helps detect bugs early, reducing debugging costs.
Example: Testing a login function to ensure it correctly validates user credentials.

2. Integration Testing
-Verifies that multiple components or modules work together correctly.
-Identifies issues in data flow, communication, and dependencies between modules.
-Ensures seamless interaction between different parts of the system.
Example: Checking if a payment system correctly processes transactions by integrating the payment gateway and user interface.

3. System Testing
-Evaluates the complete system to ensure it meets functional and technical requirements.
-Tests performance, security, and overall behavior in a real-world environment.
-Detects issues that may not appear in unit or integration testing.
Example: Running end-to-end tests on an e-commerce website to verify shopping cart functionality, order processing, and checkout.

4. Acceptance Testing
-Determines if the software meets business and user requirements.
-Conducted by end-users or stakeholders before deployment.
-Confirms Whether the software is ready for release.
Example: A client testing a newly developed mobile app to ensure it meets their expectations before launch.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering is the process of designing and refining inputs (prompts) to guide AI models in generating accurate, relevant, and high-quality responses. It involves structuring queries, using specific keywords, and optimizing instructions to improve AI performance.

Importance in AI Interaction
1. Enhances Response Accuracy – Well-crafted prompts help AI produce precise and meaningful outputs.
2. Improves Efficiency – Reduces the need for follow-up queries by providing clear and detailed instructions.
3. Customizes AI Behavior – Adjusts responses based on tone, detail level, and style preferences.
4. Optimizes Productivity – Helps developers, researchers, and businesses get useful insights faster.
5. Supports AI Applications – Essential in fields like chatbots, content generation, and coding assistance.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Vague Prompt:
"Tell me about history."

Improved Prompt:
"Summarize the causes and effects of World War II, highlighting its impact on global politics and economies."

Why the Improved Prompt is More Effective:
1. More Specific – Focuses on a particular historical event rather than all of history.
2. Clear Scope – Asks for causes, effects, and global impact, guiding the response.
3. Concise and Direct – Eliminates ambiguity, ensuring a focused and informative answer.
